In this work, we implement a low-cost visual-based positioning system on an Android-based smartphone. The experiment results show that our system is both accurate and stable for small and median-scale experiments, and has relatively low error rates in large-scale experiments. The experiment results support that our system is suitable for applications such as indoor navigation in a shopping mall or an exhibit hall, and is accurate enough for applications such as outdoor virtual augmentations and location-based services. In the future, we would like to improve our system to provide even more stable and accurate positioning. For example, multiple MRPs may be used to obtain a better accuracy. Another possible approach is to integrate with map matching~\cite{bernstein1998introduction} for a higher positioning precision. In addition, we would like to come up with a solution to better eliminate the magnetic noise or hybrid our system with the dead reckoning algorithm~\cite{jin2011robust}.
