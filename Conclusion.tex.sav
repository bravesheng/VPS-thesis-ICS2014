\label{Conclusions and future work}
In our works. We can use exist camera and sensors in smartphone to do a low-cost positioning system. In order to let this system working reliable and stability for commercial use.  There are some issues need to solve. First is the geomagnetic fields vary within the structure. Smartphone can not get precise direciton and will increase positioning error range.
